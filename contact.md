If you are generally interested in learning more about ManyDogs, we recommend reading the [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing), which includes our consortium's mission statement and more general information about the design and participating in the first study (e.g., authorship criteria, how to get involved, and methods overview). For prospective collaborators that are considering implementing ManyDogs 1, we also recommend reading the Manual as a next immediate step, then taking a look at the [Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IV2h2YXmyYpOw0U3IgxxQZD8zlkc0VHcencWx1fJm4s/edit?usp=sharing) and it's appendices for a better understanding of what data collection entails.

For information or inquiries that aren't covered by the [ManyDogs 1](/md1) resources, or if you are from the media, please [email](mailto:manydogsproject@gmail.com) the ManyDogs project coordinators.
