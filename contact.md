If you are interested in ManyDogs, we recommend reading the [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing) and [Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IV2h2YXmyYpOw0U3IgxxQZD8zlkc0VHcencWx1fJm4s/edit?usp=sharing) first. These documents contain comprehensive descriptions of how to get involved as a contributor, inclusive authorship criteria, and the methods for our social communication study. Please begin by reading those documents. 

If you have a question that isn't covered by the MD1 resources, please send the Project Coordinators an email: [manydogsproject@gmail.com](mailto:manydogsproject@gmail.com)
