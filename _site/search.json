    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigates domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.\nIn addition to directly addressing the question of how dogs are perceiving point gestures, ManyDogs 1 will allow us to investigate various methodological differences (e.g. indoor/outdoor testing, room size, owner presence) that can influence dog behavior. To answer these questions, we have implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study will help us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\nWe have pre-registered our study’s method and analysis on OSF and the pre-print of our first study (pre-registered report accepted in principle at Animal Behavior and Cognition) is now available on PsyArXiv.\n\n\nWe have designed the methods to be minimalistic and inexpensive so that the cost of running the study is low; the only materials necessary are:\n\n4 solo cups (or containers of a similar shape and size)\nan small occluder (which can be made from foam board or cardboard)\ntape or post-its to mark out the testing area\na leash\nsome dog treats\na stopwatch/timer\na chair\nvideo recording capabilities\n\nIdeally, two trained experimenters will perform all of the experimenting and dog handling, but if necessary a single trained experimenter can instruct the dog’s guardian in the role of handler. Participating researchers will need to provide proof of ethics (e.g., IACUC) approval from their institution for conducting this study (we are able to advise on obtaining ethics!).\nFor a comprehensive overview of ManyDogs 1 and instructions on how to get involved in different aspects of the study, hit the button below and also see the ManyDogs Manual. The ManyDogs 1 Protocol contains the detailed experimental protocol for collaborators and information on collecting and submitting data.\n\nGet Involved!"

    "text": "Photo credit: Eddie Galaxy\nManyDogs is an international consortium of researchers interested in Canine Science. Our primary goal is to foster global collaboration and open science practices (i.e., transparency and reproducibility) through multi-site projects. Read our Mission Statement for a detailed explanation of our purpose.\nBy forming the ManyDogs consortium, we are establishing a collegial platform for addressing new questions and replicating historical findings on a greater scale than has been possible for any single research unit to date. Collectively, we will have the power to address questions such as breed or individual differences, or the impact of culture on behaviour, both of which have important implications for dog-human interaction and general dog welfare."

The aim of ManyDogs 1 is to take a closer look at the long-debated question of whether dogs understand pointing as an informative gesture or as a command. We are currently investigating this by running a single study with standardized methodology in a large number of labs. Participating labs are currently based in North America and Europe, and we hope more researchers from around the world will join us. For more information on this study and how to get involved, please see the ManyDogs 1 section of this website."
