    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigated domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.  To answer these questions, we implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study helps us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\nWe pre-registered our study’s method and analysis on OSF as a registered report which is now published at Animal Behavior and Cognition.\nManyDogs Project, Espinosa, J., Stevens, J.R., Alberghina, D., Alway, H.E.E., Barela, J.D., Bogese, M., Bray, E.E., Buchsbaum, D.

    "text": "Dr. Cavalli is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Human Animal Interaction Lab, Animal Welfare Program, Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). While many studies in the field of dog cognition compare family dogs with dogs that have a limited experience interacting with humans, such as shelter or free ranging dogs, her research focuses on therapy dogs. This allows her to explore what happens with the socio-cognitive abilities of dogs that experience the opposite situation of having an increase in their frequency and variety of interactions with humans.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ostojić is Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Rijeka in Croatia, where she is currently Head of the Division for Cognitive Sciences. She hold an undergraduate and Masters degree in Psychology from the University of Vienna, Austria, and a PhD in Experimental Psychology from the University of Cambridge, UK. She has continued to work as a postdoctoral researcher in Cambridge on social cognition in humans, corvids, cephalopods, and dogs before moving to the University of Rijeka, where she is now continuing her research on social cognition, primarily in humans and dogs, as well as working on meta-science projects at the Centre for Mind and Behaviour, where she runs the Comparative Cognitive Science Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Stevens is a Susan J. Rosowski Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where he leads the Canine Cognition and Human Interaction Lab studying dog behavior/cognition and canine-human interaction. He obtained his undergraduate degree at Baylor University and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University and a research scientist position at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. He has worked with 15 different species, ranging from fish to birds to primates. He’s now settled down to two: dogs and humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bray is an Assistant Professor in The University of Arizona College of Veterinary Medicine and a Research Scientist at Canine Companions, the largest US non-profit providing service dogs to people with disabilities. She earned her undergraduate degree at Duke University, completing a senior thesis at the Duke Canine Cognition Center investigating context specificity of inhibitory control in pet dogs. She then went on to earn a Ph.D. from the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. For her dissertation, she partnered with The Seeing Eye—the oldest guide dog school in the United States—to conduct a longitudinal study investigating the development of behavior and cognition in dogs. Most recently, she develops and implements cognitive tasks in hundreds of dogs from Canine Companions’ population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hare leads Dog Genetics LLC where she consults on genetics and genomics research and breeding program planning in dogs.
