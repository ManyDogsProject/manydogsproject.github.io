    "title": "Mission Statement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Mission Statement\nThe past two decades have seen a dramatic increase in canine science research being conducted all around the world. Although this explosion of research has generated a number of exciting findings, the field as a whole is still relatively new. As a new field, we still have much to learn about our field’s best practices, particularly which methodological and analytical practices lead to the most replicable results. Gaining a better grasp of these best practices as a field will be crucial for facilitating replicable work.\nTo empirically address these questions regarding best practices, other subfields in psychology have begun large-scale collaborations designed to directly investigate the reproducibility of particular subfields. This progression of large-scale collaborations began with the ManyLabs project in social psychology, and that initial project has since paved the way for other reproducibility projects, most notably ManyBabies and ManyPrimates. Each ManyX project has a specific focus relevant to the concerns of its subfield; however, the overarching mission of each of these projects is the same - investigate the boundaries of reproducibility in the subfield and identify factors that influence reproducibility.\nWith ManyDogs, we are setting out to conduct our own reproducibility project in the subfield of canine science. In selecting our approach, we have chosen a similar approach to the ManyBabies project, given that the logistical concerns of infant research most closely parallel our own. First, as with infant research, research with dogs is typically more time intensive than traditional social psychology research, as each dog has to be tested one-by-one on longer behavioral measures. Second, it can be difficult to determine the cause of contradictory findings given the vast nature of individual, cultural, training, and breed differences among canine populations. These vast differences currently pose a significant barrier to determining whether contradictory findings across labs result from meaningful individual differences across different populations, different methodological approaches across labs, or simply failed replication.\nThus, the primary goals of the first ManyDogs project are to (1) enhance replicability in the field of canine science, (2) quantify differences across labs and investigate how these differences might influence study results, (3) foster collaboration, and (4) provide a platform for testing questions that require large and/or diverse samples. More details can be found on each of these below.\n\nEnhance Replicability: As with other ManyX projects (e.g., ManyBabies, ManyLabs, ManyPrimates), one of the primary missions of ManyDogs is to enhance the replicability of canine science. We aim to do this in a collaborative network that (a) uses large, diverse samples to investigate and replicate findings, (b) examines how different research methods and testing environments influence the robustness of the results, and c) promotes open science practices of preregistering hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans.\nProvide a Platform for Testing Questions that Require Large and/or Diverse Samples: We aim to develop a platform where researchers can coordinate with each other in the future to investigate questions they could not address without a large and/or diverse sample (e.g., questions about the impact of individual differences such as training history, breed, etc.).\nQuantify Differences Across Labs: As part of enhancing the replicability of results across the field of canine science, we aim to begin quantifying differences across labs (e.g., in testing environments, methodological approaches, and analysis techniques) to investigate how these differences influence study results in canine science. A closer analysis of these differences will hopefully provide useful information for developing a set of “Best Practices”, similar to what the field of infant cognition has done with the findings from ManyBabies.\nFoster Collaboration: In conducting our first ManyDogs project, we aim to foster international collaboration between diverse research labs. The hope is that this will be the first project of many, and that researchers in all areas of canine science will see this platform as a useful tool for generating additional collaborations.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we have chosen a “single study” approach, in line with ManyBabies, in which we select one specific study for all participating labs to conduct in parallel. Thus, our aim with ManyDogs is to enhance replicability in canine science by identifying factors that might influence the reproducibility of our work, while also fostering collaboration and providing a platform for testing questions that require large and/or diverse samples. Our hope is that, over time, this process will identify “best practices” in canine science that can provide a strong and replicable foundation for our quickly growing field.\nFor more information on our origin and mission, check out our introductory paper at Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews:\nManyDogs Project, Alberghina, D., Bray, E., Buchsbaum, D., Byosiere, S.-E., Espinosa, J., Gnanadesikan, G., Guran, C.-N.A., Hare, E., Horschler, D., Huber, L., Kuhlmeier, V.A., MacLean, E., Pelgrim, M.H., Perez, B., Ravid-Schurr, D., Rothkoff, L., Sexton, C., Silver, Z., & Stevens, J.R.

    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigated domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.  To answer these questions, we implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study helps us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\nWe pre-registered our study’s method and analysis on OSF as a registered report which is now published at Animal Behavior and Cognition.\nManyDogs Project, Espinosa, J., Stevens, J.R., Alberghina, D., Alway, H.E.E., Barela, J.D., Bogese, M., Bray, E.E., Buchsbaum, D.

    "text": "Do I need to obtain my own ethics approval to implement a MD study?\nYes, research activities with nonhuman animals require ethical approval or proof of exemption. Research members who intend to collect data for a MD study at their research site will be required to seek approval for the protocol from their local institutional review board and submit a copy of the approval letter prior to collecting data. At some institutions, behavioral studies with dogs do not meet the requirements to undergo a full review process and an exemption letter indicating that the study is exempt under the institutional review board’s research guidelines is sufficient. If you have questions about how to apply for ethics for an MD study, please get in touch with the study leadership team or members of the MD administrative team. Individual research members who plan to contribute to the study in other capacities besides organizing data collection in their own facility (e.g., manuscript writing, general project administration) do not need to seek ethical approval for their participation."

The outcome of this research has been featured in many news reports across TV, radio, newspapers, and other platforms.   \n\n\n\n\nThis committee is responsible for supporting ManyDogs projects in implementing open science practices and adhering to reproducibility standards, as well as developing database infrastructure/storage at the larger organization level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian is a volunteer at the Hunter College Thinking Dog Center and lab technician at Rockefeller University. His interests are on human-nonhuman animal interactions and bonds of domestic and wild species. He has a preference in studying canine cognition and behavior such as language, communication, emotions, and perception. He graduated from undergrad at City University of New York, Hunter College studying Psychology: Animal Behavior and in the Animal Behavior & Conservation Masters Advanced Certificate program. He has been helping in the Thinking Dog Center in behavioral coding of stress behavior in dog shelters, handling dogs for the Impossible tasks and Bolgna Study. He participated in the draft writing intro and as an election teller for ManyDogs.\n\n\n\n\nThis committee is responsible for applying for funding opportunities, connecting individual projects to funding opportunities, and networking with funding agencies and other big team science groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Buchsbaum is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences at Brown University. She directs the Computational Cognitive Development Lab, and its sister lab the Brown Dog Lab. Dr. Buchsbaum completed her postdoctoral work as a Senior Research Fellow in the University of St. Andrews Psychology department. She completed her doctoral training the UC Berkeley Psychology department, as well as a master’s degree in the UC Berkeley Statistics department, focusing on applications of probability theory and statistical computing. Before that, she completed a master’s degree at the MIT Media Lab, working on social learning in interactive animated characters.\n\n\n\n\nThis committee is responsible for supporting ManyDogs projects through protocol development and implementing best practices in canine science research methods.\n\n\nMia is an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. She’s currently in her senior year at the University of Arizona. For her senior thesis, she’s working on ManyDogs 1 with the Arizona Canine Cognition Center. She helps to run the experiments, and she’s collecting data on the effect of canine engagement on experimental performance for her thesis question.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Jim is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Institute for Advanced Study at Kyoto University. She is interested in animal behavior and cognition in a variety of cooperative, group-living species to further our understanding of social cognition in non-human animals. She obtained her PhD on eavesdropping in dogs, wolves, and elephants at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Johnston is an Assistant Professor at Boston College (Boston, USA). In her research, she investigates the evolutionary origins of human teaching and learning. She investigate this question from a comparative perspective, examining which aspects of human learning are unique and which are shared across other species. In particular, she compares human learning to that of domesticated dogs, as dogs demonstrate striking similarities to humans in their capacity to learn from others."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Open call\n\n\n\nWe are currently recruiting research sites to conduct the ManyDogs 2 project! If you want to participate, please contact us at manydogsproject2@gmail.com to begin the onboarding process.\n\n\nOur ManyDogs 2 project will be on overimitation in dogs. Overimitation occurs when an individual imitates another’s action that is unnecessary to achieve a goal. For example, if you see someone wipe their brow before picking up a heavy object, wiping the brow isn’t necessary to pick up the object. So copying the brow wiping would be an example of overimitation. Human children do this a lot (Hoehl et al., 2019), and dogs overimitate in certain situations (Huber et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\nDog illustrating overimitation by touching a dot, which is irrelevant to the task. Source: Huber et al., 2022\n\n\n\nIn ManyDogs 2, we plan to leverage the power of large sample sizes across many labs to study overimitation in dogs. Completing the project is a long process, so we have outlined our project milestones below, letting you know where we are in the process. Keep checking it to see how we’re coming along!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\n\nCreate project teams\nDevelop a project-specific admin team, methods team, and data teams.\n\n\n\n\nCreate milestones\nWork with MD Methods Development and Monitoring Committee to create reasonable project milestones and deadlines.
