He studies behaviour and cognition in specific ecological contexts, notably feeding and mate choice. His research employs a range of methods in several laboratory contexts, including conditioning techniques, cognitive modelling, and simulation of evolutionary processes. Some specific areas of focus include causal reasoning and social influences on mate choice. A general orienting basis for his research is a systems theoretic perspective, behaviour systems theory, which places focus on how multiple behaviours interrelate. Thinking in terms of structured, complex systems helps address questions about complex patterns of behaviour and cognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Cavalli is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Human Animal Interaction Lab, Animal Welfare Program, Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). While many studies in the field of dog cognition compare family dogs with dogs that have a limited experience interacting with humans, such as shelter or free ranging dogs, her research focuses on therapy dogs. This allows her to explore what happens with the socio-cognitive abilities of dogs that experience the opposite situation of having an increase in their frequency and variety of interactions with humans.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Johnston is an Assistant Professor at Boston College (Boston, USA). In her research, she investigates the evolutionary origins of human teaching and learning. She investigate this question from a comparative perspective, examining which aspects of human learning are unique and which are shared across other species. In particular, she compares human learning to that of domesticated dogs, as dogs demonstrate striking similarities to humans in their capacity to learn from others."

    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigates domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.\nIn addition to directly addressing the question of how dogs are perceiving point gestures, ManyDogs 1 will allow us to investigate various methodological differences (e.g. indoor/outdoor testing, room size, owner presence) that can influence dog behavior. To answer these questions, we have implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study will help us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\nWe have pre-registered our study’s method and analysis on OSF and the pre-print of our first study (pre-registered report accepted in principle at Animal Behavior and Cognition) is now available on PsyArXiv.\n\n\n\nThese research groups are registered collaborators in ManyDogs 1, and the Team Captains designated at each institution are responsible for organizing ManyDogs at their site.
