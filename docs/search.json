    "title": "Mission Statement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Mission Statement\nThe past two decades have seen a dramatic increase in canine science research being conducted all around the world. Although this explosion of research has generated a number of exciting findings, the field as a whole is still relatively new. As a new field, we still have much to learn about our field’s best practices, particularly which methodological and analytical practices lead to the most replicable results. Gaining a better grasp of these best practices as a field will be crucial for facilitating replicable work.\nTo empirically address these questions regarding best practices, other subfields in psychology have begun large-scale collaborations designed to directly investigate the reproducibility of particular subfields. This progression of large-scale collaborations began with the ManyLabs project in social psychology, and that initial project has since paved the way for other reproducibility projects, most notably ManyBabies and ManyPrimates. Each ManyX project has a specific focus relevant to the concerns of its subfield; however, the overarching mission of each of these projects is the same - investigate the boundaries of reproducibility in the subfield and identify factors that influence reproducibility.\nWith ManyDogs, we are setting out to conduct our own reproducibility project in the subfield of canine science. In selecting our approach, we have chosen a similar approach to the ManyBabies project, given that the logistical concerns of infant research most closely parallel our own. First, as with infant research, research with dogs is typically more time intensive than traditional social psychology research, as each dog has to be tested one-by-one on longer behavioral measures. Second, it can be difficult to determine the cause of contradictory findings given the vast nature of individual, cultural, training, and breed differences among canine populations. These vast differences currently pose a significant barrier to determining whether contradictory findings across labs result from meaningful individual differences across different populations, different methodological approaches across labs, or simply failed replication.\nThus, the primary goals of the first ManyDogs project are to (1) enhance replicability in the field of canine science, (2) quantify differences across labs and investigate how these differences might influence study results, (3) foster collaboration, and (4) provide a platform for testing questions that require large and/or diverse samples. More details can be found on each of these below.\n\nEnhance Replicability: As with other ManyX projects (e.g., ManyBabies, ManyLabs, ManyPrimates), one of the primary missions of ManyDogs is to enhance the replicability of canine science. We aim to do this in a collaborative network that (a) uses large, diverse samples to investigate and replicate findings, (b) examines how different research methods and testing environments influence the robustness of the results, and c) promotes open science practices of preregistering hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans.\nProvide a Platform for Testing Questions that Require Large and/or Diverse Samples: We aim to develop a platform where researchers can coordinate with each other in the future to investigate questions they could not address without a large and/or diverse sample (e.g., questions about the impact of individual differences such as training history, breed, etc.).\nQuantify Differences Across Labs: As part of enhancing the replicability of results across the field of canine science, we aim to begin quantifying differences across labs (e.g., in testing environments, methodological approaches, and analysis techniques) to investigate how these differences influence study results in canine science. A closer analysis of these differences will hopefully provide useful information for developing a set of “Best Practices”, similar to what the field of infant cognition has done with the findings from ManyBabies.\nFoster Collaboration: In conducting our first ManyDogs project, we aim to foster international collaboration between diverse research labs. The hope is that this will be the first project of many, and that researchers in all areas of canine science will see this platform as a useful tool for generating additional collaborations.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we have chosen a “single study” approach, in line with ManyBabies, in which we select one specific study for all participating labs to conduct in parallel. Thus, our aim with ManyDogs is to enhance replicability in canine science by identifying factors that might influence the reproducibility of our work, while also fostering collaboration and providing a platform for testing questions that require large and/or diverse samples. Our hope is that, over time, this process will identify “best practices” in canine science that can provide a strong and replicable foundation for our quickly growing field.\nFor more information on our origin and mission, check out our introductory paper at Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews:\nManyDogs Project, Alberghina, D., Bray, E., Buchsbaum, D., Byosiere, S.-E., Espinosa, J., Gnanadesikan, G., Guran, C.-N.A., Hare, E., Horschler, D., Huber, L., Kuhlmeier, V.A., MacLean, E., Pelgrim, M.H., Perez, B., Ravid-Schurr, D., Rothkoff, L., Sexton, C., Silver, Z., & Stevens, J.R.

    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigated domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.  To answer these questions, we implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study helps us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\n\nCheck out the newsletter for a quick summary of what we found.

    "text": "Is ManyDogs study data available for secondary analyses?\nYes, our datasets are open access and do not require advance approval to use. Data collected in ManyDogs studies is available for researchers and students to use for their own secondary data analyses and projects. If you are interested in using data from an MD study, you can find the published datasets linked through our publications page of this website. If you have questions that are not answered by the data paper corresponding to the dataset of interest, please contact the study’s corresponding author or the MD administration team with your inquiry."

Also, please notify the MD administrative team of your publication, and send any DOIs or links to conference proceedings so that your work can be featured on our website."

    "text": "How can I propose a study idea to do with the ManyDogs Project?\nWhen we are ready to consider the next project, MD will post a public call for research proposals, at which time anyone who is a research member (or willing to become a research member) and available to play a key role in leading a study is welcome to submit a proposal. Proposed projects should align with the open science and inclusivity standards of MD to maximize the participation of both individual researchers and research sites. Details on the proposal structure and content will be included in the call."

    "text": "Does ManyDogs financially support research participation?\nAt this time, MD does not financially support research participation. One of our committees is actively seeking funding opportunities that support big team science work, so this answer may change in the future. If you are aware of any such funding opportunities or would like to be involved in the committee working on obtaining funding, please contact the MD administrative team."

    "section": "Do I need to obtain my own ethics approval to implement a MD study?",
    "text": "Do I need to obtain my own ethics approval to implement a MD study?\nYes, research activities with nonhuman animals require ethical approval or proof of exemption. Research members who intend to collect data for a MD study at their research site will be required to seek approval for the protocol from their local institutional review board and submit a copy of the approval letter prior to collecting data. At some institutions, behavioral studies with dogs do not meet the requirements to undergo a full review process and an exemption letter indicating that the study is exempt under the institutional review board’s research guidelines is sufficient. If you have questions about how to apply for ethics for an MD study, please get in touch with the study leadership team or members of the MD administrative team. Individual research members who plan to contribute to the study in other capacities besides organizing data collection in their own facility (e.g., manuscript writing, general project administration) do not need to seek ethical approval for their participation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our ManyDogs 2 study will be on overimitation in dogs. Overimitation occurs when an individual imitates another’s action that is unnecessary to achieve a goal. For example, if you see someone wipe their brow before picking up a heavy object, wiping the brow isn’t necessary to pick up the object. So copying the brow wiping would be an example of overimitation. Human children do this a lot (Hoehl et al., 2019), and dogs overimitate in certain situations (Huber et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\nDog illustrating overimitation by touching a dot, which is irrelevant to the task. Source: Huber et al., 2022\n\n\n\nIn ManyDogs 2, we plan to leverage the power of large sample sizes across many labs to study overimitation in dogs. Completing the study is a long process, so we have outlined our study milestones below, letting you know where we are in the process. Keep checking it to see how we’re coming along!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted\n\n\n\nCreate project teams\nDevelop a project-specific admin team, methods team, and data teams.\n\n\n\n\nCreate milestones\nWork with MD Methods Development and Monitoring Committee to create reasonable project milestones and deadlines. Identify overall project goals and break down into sub-goals to be accomplished by each project team over specific time periods.\n\n\n\n\nSet up infrastructure\nUse tools (e.g., Google Drive, Gmail account, Slack channels, GitHub repos) to host project resources and maintain records that are easy to access and reference by all project members. Design processes and tools with the goal of promoting core principles of transparency and reproducibility. Establish communication expectations within the project teams and for updating the broader MD membership and possible collaborators external to MD (i.e., plan regular updates and project recruitment ads).\n\n\n\n\nSolicit methods ideas\nHold town hall meeting with MD community to solicit ideas about input for methods and participation guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate methods\nWork with MD Methods Development and Monitoring Committee to generate project methods. Create detailed documents of the experimental procedure, with supporting video demonstrations where appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nPresent methods\nPresent full draft of methods for feedback from MD community.\n\n\n\n\nPilot test\nPilot test methods with subjects from multiple labs. Determine clear abort criteria. Prioritize piloting in diverse labs that work with different populations to robustly test the experimental procedure.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop guidelines\nDesign project participation guidelines for researchers. Determine the authorship requirements and define project contribution areas. Outline participation periods of the project (i.e., lab enrollment window, data collection window).\n\n\n\n\nDevelop data system\nWork with MD Data Management and Open Science Committee to figure out accessible, easy-to-use data entry system.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop methods materials\nCreate relevant methods materials for participating labs, such as methods guide, 'at-a-glance' aids, participant email templates, coding sheets, survey translations, etc.\n\n\n\n\nPre-register\nWrite pre-registration materials or registered report and send out for final approval from MD community.\n\n\n\n\nRecruit labs\nWork with MD Communications and Community Building team to advertise the project and recruit participating labs. Plan and implement an advertising strategy in the months leading up to data collection. Aim to recruit labs from diverse geographical regions, or that work with different populations of dogs. Design registration process for participating labs to join MD and sign necessary participation agreements or code of conduct agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently\n\n\n\nInitiate data collection\nCoordinate with MD Communications and Community Building team to make data collection announcements.\n\n\n\n\nSupport lab progress\nWork with labs to set internal milestones for data collection. Monitor progress with regular check-ins. Provide remote support via email, video conferencing as necessary.\n\n\n\n\nClose data collection\nWithin the MD2 teams and participating labs, announce the anticipated data collection end. Allow for additional time if necessary for some groups to wrap up final participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess data\nWork with the MD Data Management and Open Science Committee to compile and prepare the data for analysis.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyse data\nFollowing the preregistered analytical plan, analyse the data.\n\n\n\n\nCreate and share results summary\nWrite a brief (1 page or less) summary of the project and preliminary results to share with the MD2 contributors and broader MD community.\n\n\n\n\nOrganize the final report writing\nFollowing the project's participation guidelines, organize the report writing process and establish reasonable timelines to complete a manuscript and supplmentary materials.\n\n\n\n\nConfirm authorship and contributions\nCollect all co-author information (e.g., with Tenzing) and confirm that co-authors have met the criteria for areas of contribution. Collect any additional non-author contributor information for acknowledgements section.\n\n\n\n\nObtain co-author manuscript approval\nCirculate the final manuscript for co-author feedback and obtain submission approval.\n\n\n\n\nUpload pre-print\nMake the pre-review manuscript available on an accessible open-access repository (e.g., PsyArXiv)\n\n\n\n\nProvide data access\nUpload the anonymized data and analysis scripts to an accessible repository (e.g., GitHub, OSF).\n\n\n\n\nSubmit manuscript\nSubmit the manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal, preferably with open-access."
