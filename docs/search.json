Our primary goal is to foster global collaboration and open science practices (i.e., transparency and reproducibility) through multi-site projects. Read our Mission Statement for a detailed explanation of our purpose.\nBy forming the ManyDogs consortium, we are establishing a collegial platform for addressing new questions and replicating historical findings on a greater scale than has been possible for any single research unit to date. Collectively, we will have the power to address questions such as breed or individual differences, or the impact of culture on behaviour, both of which have important implications for dog-human interaction and general dog welfare.\nWe have collaborators from all over the world:\nHover over dots to see lab names, and zoom and drag map to explore lab locations more closely."

    "text": "ManyDogs 1\nWe have just wrapped up our first study, ManyDogs 1, on dog-human social communication. The aim of ManyDogs 1 was to take a closer look at the long-debated question of whether dogs understand pointing as an informative gesture or as a command. We investigated this by running a single study with standardized methodology in a large number of labs in North America, South America, and Europe. For more information on this study, please see the ManyDogs 1 section of this website."

    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigated domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.  To answer these questions, we implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study helps us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\nWe pre-registered our study’s method and analysis on OSF as a registered report which is now published at Animal Behavior and Cognition.\nManyDogs Project, Espinosa, J., Stevens, J.R., Alberghina, D., Alway, H.E.E., Barela, J.D., Bogese, M., Bray, E.E., Buchsbaum, D.

Dr. Byosiere is the Director of the Thinking Dog Center at CUNY Hunter College where she focuses on studying the behavior and cognition of domestic dogs, canids, and other companion animals. She began her career at the University of Michigan and has worked at various canine cognition and behavior research groups including the Duke Canine Cognition Center, the Clever Dog Lab, and the Wolf Science Center.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Cavalli is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Human Animal Interaction Lab, Animal Welfare Program, Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). While many studies in the field of dog cognition compare family dogs with dogs that have a limited experience interacting with humans, such as shelter or free ranging dogs, her research focuses on therapy dogs. This allows her to explore what happens with the socio-cognitive abilities of dogs that experience the opposite situation of having an increase in their frequency and variety of interactions with humans.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ostojić is Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Rijeka in Croatia, where she is currently Head of the Division for Cognitive Sciences. She hold an undergraduate and Masters degree in Psychology from the University of Vienna, Austria, and a PhD in Experimental Psychology from the University of Cambridge, UK. She has continued to work as a postdoctoral researcher in Cambridge on social cognition in humans, corvids, cephalopods, and dogs before moving to the University of Rijeka, where she is now continuing her research on social cognition, primarily in humans and dogs, as well as working on meta-science projects at the Centre for Mind and Behaviour, where she runs the Comparative Cognitive Science Lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Stevens is a Susan J.

He has worked with 15 different species, ranging from fish to birds to primates. He’s now settled down to two: dogs and humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bowers is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Programme, Bilkent University, Ankara. He studies behaviour and cognition in specific ecological contexts, notably feeding and mate choice. His research employs a range of methods in several laboratory contexts, including conditioning techniques, cognitive modelling, and simulation of evolutionary processes. Some specific areas of focus include causal reasoning and social influences on mate choice. A general orienting basis for his research is a systems theoretic perspective, behaviour systems theory, which places focus on how multiple behaviours interrelate. Thinking in terms of structured, complex systems helps address questions about complex patterns of behaviour and cognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Bray is an Assistant Professor in The University of Arizona College of Veterinary Medicine and a Research Scientist at Canine Companions, the largest US non-profit providing service dogs to people with disabilities. She earned her undergraduate degree at Duke University, completing a senior thesis at the Duke Canine Cognition Center investigating context specificity of inhibitory control in pet dogs. She then went on to earn a Ph.D. from the Department of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. For her dissertation, she partnered with The Seeing Eye—the oldest guide dog school in the United States—to conduct a longitudinal study investigating the development of behavior and cognition in dogs. Most recently, she develops and implements cognitive tasks in hundreds of dogs from Canine Companions’ population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hare leads Dog Genetics LLC where she consults on genetics and genomics research and breeding program planning in dogs.

Her research program explores cognition from a developmental and evolutionary perspective. She examines the origins of our cognitive capacities in a comparative manner, studying infants, young children, non-human primates, and dogs.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMadeline is a graduate student in the Brown Dog Lab at Brown University’s Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, & Psychological Sciences. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto studying Psychology and Biology. Madeline’s current research explores how dogs make decisions, using head-mounted eye trackers to categorize dogs’ daily environment.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis committee focuses on outreach to other academic groups (globally) as well as to non-academic professionals (e.g., working dogs). It also manages the project social media accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Lazarowski is a Research Assistant Professor at Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine and Chief Scientist at Auburn University Canine Performance Sciences. Her research aims to improve detection dog selection, training, and performance by investigating factors related to early development, cognition, olfaction, and welfare.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sexton is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Population Health Sciences at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. She earned her PhD from the George Washington University Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology, where her dissertation explored co-evolution, interspecific communication, and social relationships between humans and dogs. As a postdoc at Virginia Tech, she is currently working on the Dog Aging Project, and is especially interested in One Health applications of canine science research. An accomplished writer, she is passionate about scientific outreach and journalism, and often ropes her hound, Sonder, into helping out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Sommese has worked mostly with canids, on topics spacing between ecology and behavior. His particular field of expertise is dog-human communication and dogs’ cognition. In the last 3 years, his research focused on language learning in dogs. The gifted dog project received considerable attention from the media, especially since it was the first live broadcast scientific event of its kind (‘the Genius Dog Challenge’). The outcome of this research has been featured in many news reports across TV, radio, newspapers, and other platforms.   \n\n\n\n\nThis committee is responsible for supporting ManyDogs projects in implementing open science practices and adhering to reproducibility standards, as well as developing database infrastructure/storage at the larger organization level.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Alberghina is an Associate Professor of Veterinary Ethology and Animal Welfare at Università degli Studi di Messina. Her research focuses on management factors that could affect the welfare of animal domestic species and on factors influencing the development of stereotypic behaviors. She is Diplomate at the European College of Animal Welfare and Behavioral Medicine (AWSEL).   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian is a volunteer at the Hunter College Thinking Dog Center and lab technician at Rockefeller University. His interests are on human-nonhuman animal interactions and bonds of domestic and wild species. He has a preference in studying canine cognition and behavior such as language, communication, emotions, and perception. He graduated from undergrad at City University of New York, Hunter College studying Psychology: Animal Behavior and in the Animal Behavior & Conservation Masters Advanced Certificate program. He has been helping in the Thinking Dog Center in behavioral coding of stress behavior in dog shelters, handling dogs for the Impossible tasks and Bolgna Study. He participated in the draft writing intro and as an election teller for ManyDogs.\n\n\n\n\nThis committee is responsible for applying for funding opportunities, connecting individual projects to funding opportunities, and networking with funding agencies and other big team science groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Buchsbaum is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences at Brown University.

She is interested in animal behavior and cognition in a variety of cooperative, group-living species to further our understanding of social cognition in non-human animals. She obtained her PhD on eavesdropping in dogs, wolves, and elephants at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria.  \n\n\n\n\nThis committee is responsible for creating materials/templates regarding prospective ManyDogs project submissions, reviewing prospective ManyDogs project submissions, and monitoring progress of accepted ManyDogs projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Johnston is an Assistant Professor at Boston College (Boston, USA). In her research, she investigates the evolutionary origins of human teaching and learning. She investigate this question from a comparative perspective, examining which aspects of human learning are unique and which are shared across other species. In particular, she compares human learning to that of domesticated dogs, as dogs demonstrate striking similarities to humans in their capacity to learn from others."

Our primary goal is to foster global collaboration and open science practices (i.e., transparency and reproducibility) through multi-site projects. Read our Mission Statement for a detailed explanation of our purpose.\nBy forming the ManyDogs consortium, we are establishing a collegial platform for addressing new questions and replicating historical findings on a greater scale than has been possible for any single research unit to date. Collectively, we will have the power to address questions such as breed or individual differences, or the impact of culture on behaviour, both of which have important implications for dog-human interaction and general dog welfare.\nWe have collaborators from all over the world:\nHover over dots to see lab names, and zoom and drag map to explore lab locations more closely."

The aim of ManyDogs 1 was to take a closer look at the long-debated question of whether dogs understand pointing as an informative gesture or as a command. We investigated this by running a single study with standardized methodology in a large number of labs in North America, South America, and Europe. For more information on this study, please see the ManyDogs 1 section of this website."
