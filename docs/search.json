    "text": "The first ManyDogs study investigated domestic dogs’ understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated.\nIn addition to directly addressing the question of how dogs are perceiving point gestures, ManyDogs 1 allows us to investigate various methodological differences (e.g. indoor/outdoor testing, room size, owner presence) that can influence dog behavior. To answer these questions, we implemented an approach in which the core methodological details are standardized across all participating labs, but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses. Some of these other aspects include dog breed, sex, and age. When collected on a small scale in a single lab it can be challenging to gather enough data to get a satisfying answer. Collectively, this multi-lab study helps us gain a better understanding of the factors that influence dog behavior.\nWe pre-registered our study’s method and analysis on OSF and have a registered report in press at Animal Behavior and Cognition (pre-print available on PsyArXiv).\n\n\n\nThese research groups are registered collaborators in ManyDogs 1, and the Team Captains designated at each institution are responsible for organizing ManyDogs at their site.
