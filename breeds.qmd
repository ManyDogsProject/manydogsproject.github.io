title: "Dog breeds"
---

This is a list of all allowable breeds for our study. To search for your breed, type Ctrl/Cmd+F or click _Edit_ > _Find in Page_, then start typing the breed name. Find the breed name closest to your breed and select that for the survey question.

Note: If your breed is a crossbreed (e.g., doodles), they will not be included in this list of single breeds. To enter doodles, go back to the previous question and select crossbreed instead of single breed.
