# ManyDogs 2: Overimitation

Our ManyDogs 2 project will be on overimitation in dogs. Overimitation occurs when an individual imitates another's action that is unnecessary to achieve a goal. For example, if you see someone wipe their brow before picking up a heavy object, wiping the brow isn't necessary to pick up the object. So copying the brow wiping would be an example of overimitation. Human children do this **a lot** ([Hoehl et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dr.2018.12.002)), and dogs overimitate in certain situations ([Huber et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13420-019-00400-w)).

In ManyDogs 2, we plan to leverage the power of large sample sizes across many labs to study overimitation in dogs. Completing the project is a long process, so we have outlined our project milestones below, letting you know where we are in the process. Keep checking it to see how we're coming along!

## Project Milestones

### `r phases[1]`

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
md2_project_development <- md2_milestones |> 
  filter(Phase == phases[1])
create_tml_split(df = md2_project_development, # the data frame
           smr = "summary", # the column that will be used in the summary 
           dsc = "description", # the column that will be used in the description
           split = 6
           )
```


### `r phases[2]`

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
md2_data_collection <- md2_milestones |> 
  filter(Phase == phases[2])
create_tml_split(df = md2_data_collection, # the data frame
           smr = "summary", # the column that will be used in the summary 
           dsc = "description", # the column that will be used in the description
           split = 1
           )
```


### `r phases[3]`

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
md2_data_processing <- md2_milestones |> 
  filter(Phase == phases[3])
create_tml_split(df = md2_data_processing, # the data frame
           smr = "summary", # the column that will be used in the summary 
           dsc = "description", # the column that will be used in the description
           split = 1
           )
```
