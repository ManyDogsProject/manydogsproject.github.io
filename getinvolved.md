# Get Involved in ManyDogs

There are multiple ways that you can get involved in ManyDogs, and contributors at all stages of their careers (Undergraduate to Professor Emeritus) are very welcome. 

At this stage, **we have an open call for contributors** who are able to collect data for MD1. If your research site would like to sign up, please read the [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing)  before registering through our [Contributor Sign-Up Survey](https://bit.ly/2OQujZZ).

If you would like to get involved but do not have a site for behavioural data collection, please get in touch anyway! There are multiple administrative and creative roles that meet authorship criteria. 

# Join Our Communication Network

To receive periodic project updates, you can join our **GoogleGroup** (i.e., email list). For more frequent communication, you can join our [**Slack Workspace**](https://manydogsproject.slack.com), where much of our day-to-day discussion takes place. In either case, please [email](mailto:manydogsproject@gmail.com) the project coordinators specifying the email address that you would like to have added.
