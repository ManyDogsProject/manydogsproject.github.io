# Get Involved in ManyDogs

There are multiple ways that you can get involved in ManyDogs, and contributors at all stages of their careers (Undergraduate to Professor Emeritus) are very welcome to join the project.  

## The overall project

The ManyDogs Project is a large group of researchers who hope to conduct a number of studies over the next several years. If you're interested in becoming a member of the overall project, please complete the [Member Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdf_VKUTtblsFNOKItO1W67zQz5Po2NKYMD71k4z5gh_Inuyg/). If you want to participate in a particular study, (e.g., ManyDogs 1), no need to complete the Member Registration Form---just skip down to the Contributor Sign-Up Survey below for the study you're interested in.

## ManyDogs 1

At this time, **we have an open call for contributors** who are able to collect data for ManyDogs 1. If your research site would like to register for data collection, please read the [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing) and prereview the [questions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xgxU9X5KeUAAPcUl5dB8LfgPjO55p3Ea/view?usp=sharing) you will need to answer before registering through our [Contributor Sign-Up Survey](https://bit.ly/md1contributor) - this will ensure you have all the required information available to sign up your research site. 

If you would like to get involved but do not have a site for behavioural data collection, please get in touch anyway! There are administrative, funding acquisition, and creative roles within ManyDogs that can lead to authorship on this or subsequent studies. 

If you want to participate in ManyDogs 1 with your dog, check out our [Collaborators](/collaborators) for a complete list of the locations where ManyDogs 1 is being offered. If there's a location near you, we recommend that you reach out to them for details on how to sign up for their research program.
