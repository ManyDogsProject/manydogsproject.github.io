# Get Involved in ManyDogs

There are multiple ways that you can get involved in ManyDogs, and contributors at all stages of their careers (Undergraduate to Professor Emeritus) are very welcome to join the project.  

At this time, **we have an open call for contributors** who are able to collect data for ManyDogs 1. If your research site would like to register for data collection, please read the [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing)  before registering through our [Contributor Sign-Up Survey](https://bit.ly/2OQujZZ).

If you would like to get involved but do not have a site for behavioural data collection, please get in touch anyway! There are administrative, funding acquisition, and creative roles within ManyDogs that can lead to authorship on this or subsequent studies. 

If you want to participate in ManyDogs 1 with your dog, check out our [Collaborators](/collaborators) for a complete list of the locations where ManyDogs 1 is taking place. If there's a location near you, we suggest that you reach out to them for details on how to sign up with their institution.
