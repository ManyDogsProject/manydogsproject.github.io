# ManyDogs 1: Social Communication

The first ManyDogs study (MD1) investigates domestic dogs' understanding of a common human gesture, the point. Previous research shows that dogs usually follow pointing cues, but whether they do so because they are following a communicative cue from a human partner or because they feel compelled to follow the gesture as a command is still debated. 

Furthermore, we don't know how various methodological differences that are common among labs (e.g. indoor/outdoor testing, room size, owner presence) might affect study results in our field, so we have implemented an approach by which the core methodological details are standardized but other aspects are allowed to vary and are recorded for subsequent exploratory analyses.

## Implementing MD1 at your site

We have designed the methods to be minimalistic and inexpensive so that the cost of running the study is low; the only materials necessary are:

* solo cups (or items of a similar shape and size) 
* an occluder (which can be made from foam board or cardboard) 
* tape or post-its to mark out the testing area 
* a leash 
* some dog treats 
* a stopwatch/timer 
* a chair 
* and video recording capabilities 

Ideally, two trained experimenters will perform all of the experimenting and dog handling, but if necessary a single trained experimenter can instruct the dog's guardian in the role of handler. Participating researchers will need to provide proof of ethics (e.g., IACUC) approval from their institution for conducting this study (we are able to advise on obtaining ethics!). 

For a comprehensive overview of MD1 and how to get involved, see the MD1 [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing). 

We have pre-registered our study's method and analysis on [OSF](https://osf.io/9r5xf/). For a thoroughly detailed experimental procedure, please read the [Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IV2h2YXmyYpOw0U3IgxxQZD8zlkc0VHcencWx1fJm4s/edit?usp=sharing).
