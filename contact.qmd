The ManyDogs Project is an international consortium of researchers interested in canine science.

If you are interested in learning more about ManyDogs, we recommend reading the [Introduction](https://doi.org/10.3819/CCBR.2023.180004) and the  [Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuYElQSssoOMVC3nu7BLrFZovoM0TIEqmGM1bUaYbpo/edit?usp=sharing), which includes our consortium's mission statement and more general information about the design and participating in the first study (e.g., authorship criteria, how to get involved, and methods overview). <!--For prospective collaborators that are considering implementing ManyDogs 1, we also recommend reading the Manual as a next immediate step, then taking a look at the [Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IV2h2YXmyYpOw0U3IgxxQZD8zlkc0VHcencWx1fJm4s/edit?usp=sharing) and it's appendices for a better understanding of what data collection entails.-->
