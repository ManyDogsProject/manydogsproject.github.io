#### Robert Ian Bowers

[Dr. Bowers](http://www.psy.bilkent.edu.tr/faculty/faculty-members/robert-ian-bowers-ph-d/) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Programme, Bilkent University, Ankara. He studies behaviour and cognition in specific ecological contexts, notably feeding and mate choice. His research employs a range of methods in several laboratory contexts, including conditioning techniques, cognitive modelling, and simulation of evolutionary processes. Some specific areas of focus include causal reasoning and social influences on mate choice. A general orienting basis for his research is a systems theoretic perspective, behaviour systems theory, which places focus on how multiple behaviours interrelate. Thinking in terms of structured, complex systems helps address questions about complex patterns of behaviour and cognition.


#### Camila Cavalli

[Dr. Cavalli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camila-cavalli%20/) is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Human Animal Interaction Lab](https://awp.landfood.ubc.ca/human-animal-interaction-lab/), Animal Welfare Program, Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). While many studies in the field of dog cognition compare family dogs with dogs that have a limited experience interacting with humans, such as shelter or free ranging dogs, her research focuses on therapy dogs. This allows her to explore what happens with the socio-cognitive abilities of dogs that experience the opposite situation of having an increase in their frequency and variety of interactions with humans. <br> <br> 


#### Angie Johnston

::: {.column-margin}
![](images/angie_johnston.jpg)
:::

[Dr. Johnston](https://sites.bc.edu/angiejohnston) is an Assistant Professor at Boston College (Boston, USA). In her research, she investigates the evolutionary origins of human teaching and learning. She investigate this question from a comparative perspective, examining which aspects of human learning are unique and which are shared across other species. In particular, she compares human learning to that of domesticated dogs, as dogs demonstrate striking similarities to humans in their capacity to learn from others.
