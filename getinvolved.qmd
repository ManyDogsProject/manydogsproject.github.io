# Get Involved in ManyDogs

The ManyDogs Project is a large group of researchers who hope to conduct a number of studies over the next several years. [ManyDogs 1](manydogs1.qmd) has completed, and the manuscript with the main experimental results has been published at [_Animal Behavior and Cognition_](https://doi.org/10.26451/abc.10.03.03.2023). We are now working on ManyDogs 2: check out our progress through our [project milestones](manydogs2.qmd).

There are multiple ways that you can get involved in ManyDogs, and _research contributors_ at all stages of their careers (Undergraduate to Professor Emeritus) are very welcome to join the project. If you're interested in becoming a member of the ManyDogs project and helping out with behavioral data collection,  administration,  and/or creative roles, please complete the [Member Registration Form](https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6XLshnyTmIOWiua). 

Not able to contribute to the research but still interested in ManyDogs? You can [sign up for our mailing list](https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3P3FKn7i0NuYq8u) to receive occasional updates about what we're doing.


## Other Big Team Science Groups
