ManyDogs is an international consortium of researchers interested in canine science. Our primary goal is to foster global collaboration and open science practices (i.e., transparency and reproducibility) through multi-site projects. Read our [Mission Statement](mission.qmd) for a detailed explanation of our purpose. 

By forming the ManyDogs consortium, we are establishing a collegial platform for addressing new questions and replicating historical findings on a greater scale than has been possible for any single research unit to date. Collectively, we will have the power to address questions such as breed or individual differences, or the impact of culture on behavior, both of which have important implications for dog-human interaction and general dog welfare.

We have collaborators from all over the world:

## Projects

We have completed our first study, [ManyDogs 1](manydogs1.qmd), on dog-human social communication. The aim of ManyDogs 1 was to take a closer look at the long-debated question of whether dogs understand pointing as an informative gesture or as a command. We investigated this by running a single study with standardized methodology on over 700 dogs in 20 research sites in North America, South America, and Europe.


### ManyDogs 2

We are currently recruiting research sites for our next study. Check out our [ManyDogs 2 project page](manydogs2.qmd) for more information!
